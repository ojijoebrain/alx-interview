# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project contains a Python script that rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, modifying the matrix in place.

## Usage

You can run the Python script directly. It will modify the matrix in place without returning anything.

### Example:

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)

# Output:
# [
#   [7, 4, 1],
#   [8, 5, 2],
#   [9, 6, 3]
# ]
